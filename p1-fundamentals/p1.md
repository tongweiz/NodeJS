* Node provides an event-driven and asynchronous platform for server-side JavaScript.
  ```
  $.post('/resource.json', function (data) {
  console.log(data);
  });
  // script execution continues, I/O doesn't block execution
  ```
* JavaScript language helps open up an exciting world of data-intensive real-time applications.
* DIRTy applications - Data Intensive Real Time
* Node stream data
* Node also provides writable streams that you can write chunks of data to. One of those is the response (res) object when a request happens on an HTTP server.
* Web-Socket (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket), which was designed as a bidirectional lightweight communications protocol to support real-time communication.
* The JavaScript files run on the client need to be served as static assets, rather than being executed by Node.
* it’s common for Node applications to cache frequently used data in memory
* Socket.IO, out of the box, provides virtual channels, so instead of broadcasting every message to every connected user, you can broadcast only to those who have subscribed to a specific channel. This functionality makes implementing chat rooms in your application quite simple
## Small chat roon web application
* create a static file server
  * provide the ability to interact with filesystem, also determine a file MIME type
    * Three functions are needed to handle file request
      * send404, file not found
      * sendFile, fild found
      * serveStatic, read file if file content not cached in memory
* create the http server
  * s
